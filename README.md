# MechSupercharger
This is a Rimworld mod that adds machanoid superchargers.

The mech supercharger and Large mech supercharger both allow charging from the same speed as the vanilla chargers up to 10 times faster than the vanilla charger. Any charging speed faster than vanilla charging produces 25% more toxic waste using the normal superchargers.
There are also 2 advanced superchargers that depend on the Wastepack Atomizer research. The advanced superchargers has a wastepack atomizer built in to the charger so they produce no external toxic waste.
